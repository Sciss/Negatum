# Negatum

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Sciss/Negatum.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Sciss/Negatum)

## statement

Negatum started as a genetic programming experiment for SoundProcesses,
and eventually became entangled with the particular sound installation of
the same name that was part of the exhibition "Imperfect Reconstruction".
In the future, its extensions to SoundProcesses will become part of
SoundProcesses/Mellite.
