Why are many optimizations still fail to produce the equivalent output? Hypotheses:

- UGen order and number changes for those that poll RNG
- replacements produce constants which are subsequently eliminated from participating in `Mix`?
- or two "same" elements from a `Mix` are coalesced into a single leaf node, thus changing its
  gain / contribution
