# Problem

Why are many optimizations still fail to produce the equivalent output? Hypotheses:

- UGen order and number changes for those that poll RNG
- replacements produce constants which are subsequently eliminated from participating in `Mix`?
- or two "same" elements from a `Mix` are coalesced into a single leaf node, thus changing its
  gain / contribution

# Observations

- `Pulse` behaves differently for `width = 1.0`, depending on the block-size. So in real-time,
  with default block size, we see a single spike, while in bounce, with block-size 1, we see
  nothing.
- the quick fix of course would be to use block-size 64 in bounce.
- for new renderings, we will probably want to exclude `width == 0` or `width == 1.0` in `Pulse`.
