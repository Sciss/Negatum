## Notes 190708

The way it was run is to capture a target sound, then initiate the genetic programming via `Negatum`, then
every couple of iterations (?) select candidates using an `SVMModel`, trained previously using a corpus of annotated
folders; the selected candidates are added to a `SOM`. The SVM is based on the feature vector also used in the
GP, and a hand annotated "label", which is a binary state (in, out).

So technically, we have three independent abstractions / objects: The GP process, stored as a folder with
instances of `Proc`, and a target sound file; the SVM model to select "suitable" individuals (technically this
would not require a `Negatum` but could just work with any annotated `Folder`); the `SOM`, which again does not
rely on any of the other objects.
